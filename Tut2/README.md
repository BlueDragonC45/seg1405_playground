# Chapter 2
The first issue with shaping is defining the medium of expressing the ideas from the shaper to the developers. While doing detail mock-ups details exactly what needs to be done, it stifles creativity which is never good. Alternatively, just describing it in just words doesn't actually give the requirments in a way that the developers can use. The solution is that the finished project is rough, solved, and bounded. It need to be ubnfinished, so that the developers aren't constrained, but must actually tell them what to do. It also has the boundaries that tell the developers when it is complete and they can finish working. Shaping needs to be done by people that understand the technology, but not necessarily the developers, as it is defined as design work. The timeline is not set in stone, this is the purpose of the two tracks in shaping, so there is no strict time constraints.

# Chapter 3
Setting boundaries is very important, to constrain the conversation an keep it from going from a small change to a ful overhaul. Fisrt, we need to make sure the have time to invest in the idea we shape. This is called the appetite. The next principle is Fixed time, variable scope. It sets a deadline to allow the developers to prioritize their time to make the correct trade-off decisions. This applies to all sections of shaping. We also need to consider that there is no best solution, and that good is relative to what you can achieve in the time limit. After we have define what we have time to do and when we will do it by, we then need to understand the problem. This means getting the bare minimum requirements, and building up from there. A thing to be caseful about is grab-bags, unclear ideas that don't have a scope that can be defined, stuff like redesigns or refactorings. They could be straightforward, but there are often large problems that appear despite the appearance of simplicity.

# Chapter 4
Now that we have the problem and the constraints, we move towards actionable solutions to give to developers. Here, we need to be careful about keeping the right speed. This means talking to the right people, to keep from getting too deep into rabbit holes, and not getting distracted. It also means using just the right anout of detail in the diagrams. Not adding unnecessary details, be still being able to answer the important questions that our design needs to have. Breadboarding is a concept that is used to help with this, and is intended to keep things bare-bones and slightly abstract, so we keep within design instead of implementation. We just need to show the places we can go, the things the user can interact with, and how the connect, and nothing more. Fat marker sketches are the other popular way to mock in the right detail. The 'fat' part comes from the idea that we cannot get detailed in a large print. This type of implementation leaves room for input from the designers and later the developers, and allows the creative freedom to make the needed changes based on implementation requirements. What we have at this stage isn't finished yet, and hasn't had a bet made on it, and could be abandoned at any time.

# Chapter 5
What we need to remember at this stage is that we are looking work for a fixed window of time. Any unanticipated problems could take a huge amount of time to solve, and cause large time and cost overruns, or even failure. There are always unknowns, but when shaping we need to consider as many risks and issues as possible to minimize the time spent in development. Risk will generally only incease the delay by a small amount, but rabbit holes can cause much more time to fix than initially assumed. Rabbit holes are things like technical unknowns, unsolved design problems, or misunderstood interdependencies. 
We want to consiter all of these issues in advance if possible, so the developers know where to stop looking into things that will not have a definable ending. This rabbit hole step is near the end, where the shapers take the time to slop down and think more about depth than breadth, much more critically. For example, working through a use case in slow motion. We also neeed to definitively declare what is out of bounds and will result in a rabbit hole, cut back to only what is necessary to fil this time frame. We also need to present our idea to the technical experts, to make sure that all the assumption that have been made so far are accurate, and won't cause larger problems later. Once we have made our attempt to remove risk and rabbit holes, we now we need to write up the documentation. This means we are finshing up with the shaping, and are moving onto the betting stage.
